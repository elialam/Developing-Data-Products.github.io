### Welcome to Hair-Eye Color Distribution Explorer

This application is developed as an assignment for "Develoing Data Products" course offered by Coursera.

The App workes based on "HairEyeColor" dataset which is a distribution of hair and eye color and gender in 592 statistics students.The data has been collected through a survey of students at the University of Delaware reported by Snee (1974) . It is a 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 592 observations on 3 variables(hair color,eye color,gender)

As this App is part of an assignment for "Developing Data Products" course, it works just based on a very simplified assumption that frequency/infrequency of Hair-Eye color mix for every individual followes the distribution of above mentioned data set! 

### How to use the App

Simply choose the closest choice of your hair and eye color in relevant menu as well as your gender,and then press "Go!" button to see how rare you are among people with regards to your hair-eye color mix!
